            - Manually set up intertial frames (e.g. for REFSMMAT).
            - Cannot be combined with other frames.
            - Used for delta-v maneuvers
            - Angle definition:
                - Elevation: declination, measured from VU-plane towards W-vector.
                - Heading: right ascension, measured CCW from V- to U-vector.
