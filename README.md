# Welcome to MyRocketSimulator!
MyRocketSimulator is a Python library for spacecraft orbit propagation around the Earth and missions towards and around the Moon. It provides the simulation environment for
the authorâ€™s plan to replicate the complete trajectory of Apollo 11, from launch to splashdown. Necessary parts for such an undertaking a continuously added to MRS. 

The simulator relies on a high-fidelity propagator that includes all relevant perturbating forces, such as drag, SRP, gravity with spherical harmonics and third body gravity. A published in-depth comparison with GMAT proved its accuracy for Earth orbiting spacecrafts. Download the paper [Spacecraft Orbit Propagation in an Open-Source Python Environment]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375293398_Spacecraft_Orbit_Propagation_in_an_Open-Source_Python_Environment).

An early, non-published release of MRS was used to perform a preliminary flight simulation and analysis of the Moon-bound Artemis I mission. Download the paper [Preliminary Launch Trajectory Simulation for Artemis I with the Space Launch System]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362270344_Preliminary_Launch_Trajectory_Simulation_for_Artemis_I_with_the_Space_Launch_System).

Relevant features of MRS 1.0:
-	Multi-segment simulations providing distinct force configurations and delta-v maneuvers. 
-	Earth and Moon gravity with spherical harmonics using [pyshtools]( https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/).
-	Third bodies (Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Moon).
-	Precise ephemeris and coordinate transformations through [Skyfield]( https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/).
-	Atmospheric modelling with [PyNRLMSISE-00](https://github.com/st-bender/pynrlmsise00).
-	DOP853 integration.
-	Data frame export, including more than 60 run-time variables.
-	Import of external state vectors for 1:1 trajectory comparison.
-	Pre-configured visualizations. 

The typical workflow of MRS has three steps:
- Define the mission settings, e.g. by writing your own mission file or editing a provided file.
- Run the propagation.
- Add required data and export the data frame for further use. 

Exemplary visualization of flight with two delta-v maneuvers in order to raise the spacecraft's altitude:

## Installation
### PyPI
MRS can be automatically installed trough its release on PyPI ([Link](https://pypi.org/project/myrocketsimulator/)). Simply execute the following command: 

`pip install myrocketsimulator`

### Github
The MRS library can be manually downloaded from Gibthub ([Link](https://github.com/ThibaultBS/MyRocketSimulator)). After downloading the repository, simply execute the following command in its top folder:

`pip install .`

## Getting started
After installation, you are ready to start with your first simulation. The following code performs a 24-hour propagation of the ISS, using the included MRS default mission. Please note that Skyfield and spaceweather will require an internet connection to download relevant data, such as ephemeris files.

```python
# import MRS libraries
from myrocketsimulator import MRSlib, MRSvislib

# make MRSMission object with the default MRS mission
MRSdemo0mission = MRSlib.MRSmission('defaultMRSmission')

# run mission
MRSdemo0mission.run_mission()

# add latitude and longitude data to the data frame 
MRSdemo0mission.expand_DFname(['EarthLLA'])

# make MRSvislib object with the performed mission
MRSdemo0viewer = MRSvislib.MRSviewer(MRSdemo0mission)

# show ground track
MRSdemo0viewer.plot_GroundtrackEarth()
```
The console output will be:
```
MRS:		Using default mission.
MRS:		Loading mission object 'defaultMRSmission'.
MRS:		Mission 'Default MRS Mission (ISS)' loaded.
MRS:		Checking mission data validity.
MRS:		Loading Default MRS spacecraft (ISS) as static spacecraft.
MRS:		Mission data valid.
MRS:		Running mission Default MRS Mission (ISS).
MRS:		Processing mission segment 0.
MRS:		Mission ended. Processing time: 12.652 seconds.
MRS:		Adding Earth LLA to dataframe.
MRSviewer:	Loading dataframe of mission Default MRS Mission Update.
```

The ground track will be shown as a figure:

## Demo missions
The github repository contains demo missions that demonstrate different features of MyRocketSimulator. They can be used as template for your own missions.
- MRSexample0: simple propagation of the ISS (see Getting started)
- MRSexample1: satellite propagation and GMAT comparison
- MRSexample2: high accurate propagation with GMAT orbital element comparison
- MRSexample3: two delta-v maneuvers to perform a Hohmann transfer

Demo missions will be added for later versions of MRS featuring new relevant functions.

## Documentation
MRS does currently not provide its own help function or further documentation, but can be easily learned by using the following resources:
- Demo missions.
- The publication [Spacecraft Orbit Propagation in an Open-Source Python Environment]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375293398_Spacecraft_Orbit_Propagation_in_an_Open-Source_Python_Environment) contains a good summary of MRS 1.0/1.1 features. 
- Read the code of the MRS default mission (myrocketsimulator/data/defaultMRSmission.py).
- Print the docstrings of all methods used in the demo mission, e.g. through:
```python
print(MRSlib.MRSmission.load_mission.__doc__)
```
- Read the code of MRSlib's exportDataframes() to learn what data can be added to the data frame.
